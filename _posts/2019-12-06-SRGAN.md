## Introduction

Today we are going to talk about object detection in the satellite images.

Previous research runs object detection models on the 30 cm/px resolution data. 30 cm/px stands for 30 cm per pixel, meaning that each pixel in the satellite images represent a 30 cm &times; 30 cm square on the ground.

The resolution of this dataset is pretty decent in terms of overhead imagery. In fact, this dataset is gathered by airplanes but not satellites. Therefore, it is very hard in reality to get access to a dataset of overhead imagery with this high ground resolution, especially when considering costs and accessibility (it is not allowed to take overhead images using airplanes).

On the contrary, there are tons of free and globally available datasets of satellite imagery that comes with less ground resolution. For instance, [USGS](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) launched the [Landsat 9](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-9) mission providing 30 m/px global images for various bands at no charge.

What if we could utilize a neural network model to generate super-resolved images from low-resolution satellite images so that we could gain an more accessible way to high resolution satellite images anywhere on Earth. In addition, if we could build a baseline object detection model to test how well we does in the super-resolving task, we could quantitively analyze the performance of our super-resolution model in terms of object detection performances. This is what we did in this project.
